TITLE: Blogs and blogc

I like reading blogs online. I've been floating the idea of writing my own blog
for a while, and now I'm giving it a shot! This will mostly focus on whatever
open source software I'm currently using, and what I'm doing with it. For now,
lets talk about how I got this blog up and running!

The first step was to figure out what blogging software to use. I didn't want
some bloated Javascript mess that ran slow on modest servers. I wanted a simple,
static website that could be served quickly and displayed properly on a good
range of devices.

[ssg](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html) was a early contender, since it
was very small, simple to use, and ran almost entirely with Bourne shell
scripting, but it ended up not suiting my needs once I started to build a
website with it.

Afterwards, I looked around for another simple static website generator and
found [blogc](https://blogc.rgm.io/), which is what this site using now. blogc
isn't a full blogging engine as-is, it can only compile individual webpages. You
need to use Makefiles or similar to build an entire blog. Thankfully there is an
[example blog](https://github.com/blogc/blogc-example) with a decent layout that
you can use to get started early.
