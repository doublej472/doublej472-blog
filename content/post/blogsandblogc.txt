I like to read blogs and articles online. Here are some of my favorites in no
particular order:

* [DragonflyBSD Digest](https://www.dragonflydigest.com/)
* [LWN](https://lwn.net/)
* [Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com)
* [Planet Arch Linux](https://planet.archlinux.org/)
* [Planet Gentoo](https://planet.gentoo.org/)
* [Roman Zolotarev](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/)
* [Undeadly](https://undeadly.org/)

Anyways, I've been floating the idea of writing my own blog recently, and now
I'm giving it a shot! This blog will focus on whatever open source software I'm
currently using, and what I'm doing with it. For now, lets talk about how I got
this blog up and running.

The first step I took was to figure out what blogging software to use. I didn't
want some bloated Javascript mess that ran slow on devices or servers. I wanted
a simple, static website that could be served quickly and displayed properly on
a good range of devices.

[ssg](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html) was a early contender, since it
was very small, simple to use, and ran almost entirely with Bourne shell
scripting, but it ended up not suiting my needs once I started building this
blog. It wasn't possible to easily stitch multiple blog posts together on one
page. You had to keep each blog post on it's own webpage, unless you wanted to
copy everything onto one page on your own. It still is a great simple static
website generator for other projects, so feel free to give it a try if you
want, it's definitely in consideration for any future websites I create.

Afterwards, I spent more time looking for another website generator and found
[blogc](https://blogc.rgm.io/), a blog complier written in C. blogc isn't a
full blogging engine out of the box, it can only compile individual webpages.
You need to use Makefiles or something similar to build a proper blog.
Thankfully there is a decent [example
blog](https://github.com/blogc/blogc-example) that you can use to get started
easily. In my case, I ripped out the included jquery and bootstrap code, and
rewrote the templates to work well without them, plus adding some CSS of my
own. The included Makefile works very well, and only needed minimal
modification (mostly rewriting where files are located).

Now I need somewhere to host this blog at. I wanted to use an
[OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/) server with their
[httpd](https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8) daemon to host this blog. This is
becuase I want to try something different from what I normally do, which is use
the [Apache web server](https://httpd.apache.org/) with a server distribution
of Linux, like [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/). Thankfully, the man pages in
OpenBSD are nothing short of excellent, and Roman Zolotarev has great posts on
how to [configure httpd](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/openbsd/httpd.html) and
[enable HTTPS with Let's
Encrypt](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/openbsd/acme-client.html).

I also needed a good VPS provider that supports OpenBSD (my home connection is
pretty terrible), and [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/servers/openbsd) fits the
bill perfectly! For now I don't need a loadbalancer (especially for a personal,
static blog), so people will be fetching webpages directly with the httpd
daemon on 1 server.

Now we are here, I have a decent looking and easy to edit blog that is running
on OpenBSD using httpd! I'll have some other interesting posts up here soon,
so keep your eyes out for new posts!
