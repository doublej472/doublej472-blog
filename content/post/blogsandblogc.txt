I like to read blogs and articles online. Here are some of my favorites in no
particular order:

* [DragonflyBSD Digest](https://www.dragonflydigest.com/)
* [LWN](https://lwn.net/)
* [Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com)
* [Planet Arch Linux](https://planet.archlinux.org/)
* [Planet Gentoo](https://planet.gentoo.org/)
* [Roman Zolotarev](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/)
* [Undeadly](https://undeadly.org/)

Anyways, I've been floating the idea of writing my own blog recently, and now
I'm giving it a shot! This blog will (for now) focus on whatever open source
software I'm currently using, and what I'm doing with it. For now, lets talk
about how I got this blog up and running.

The first step I took was to figure out what blogging software to use. I didn't
want some bloated Javascript mess that ran slow on devices or servers. I wanted
a simple, static website that could be served quickly and displayed properly on
a good range of devices.

[ssg](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html) was a early contender, since it
was very small, simple to use, and ran almost entirely with Bourne shell
scripting, but it ended up not suiting my needs once I started to build a
website with it. Mostly, it wasn't simple to stitch multiple blogs together on
one webpage, each blog post had to be it's own webpage, unless you wanted to
copy everything onto one page on your own. It still is a great simple static
website generator, so feel free to give it a try if you want, it's definitely in
consideration for any future websites I create.

Afterwards, I spent more time looking for another simple static website
generator and found [blogc](https://blogc.rgm.io/), a blog complier writing in
C. blogc isn't a full blogging engine out of the box, it can only compile
individual webpages. You need to use Makefiles or similar to build an entire
blog. Thankfully there is an [example
blog](https://github.com/blogc/blogc-example) with a decent layout that you can
use to get started easily. In my case, I ripped out the included jquery and
bootstrap code, and rewrote the templates to work well without them. The
Makefile worked very well, and needed only minimal modifications (mostly
rewriting where files are located).
